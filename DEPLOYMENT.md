## 🌐 Deployment Options

### **Option 1: Vercel (Recommended for Static)**
```bash
# 1. Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# 2. Deploy
vercel --prod

# 3. Files deployed:
# - index.html (main portfolio)
# - All static assets
```

**Vercel Configuration** (`vercel.json`):
```json
{
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "index.html",
      "use": "@vercel/static"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### **Option 2: Render (Full Stack)**
```bash
# 1. Connect GitHub repo to Render
# 2. Choose "Static Site" for HTML only
# 3. Or "Web Service" for Python integration

# Build Command: (none needed for static)
# Publish Directory: ./
```

### **Option 3: Netlify**
```bash
# Drag and drop deployment:
# 1. Go to netlify.com
# 2. Drag entire folder
# 3. Site deploys automatically
```

## 🐍 Python Hand Tracking

### **Local Development**
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run hand tracking
python hand_tracking_demo.py
```

### **Dependencies** (requirements.txt)
```
opencv-python==4.8.1.78
mediapipe==0.10.21
numpy==1.24.3
```
